        <p>The sun, eight planets, and satellites make up the solar system. Asteroids, comets, dust, small planets, and gas are among the other objects found in space. The Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars make up the inner solar system, whereas the asteroid belt is between Mars and Jupiterâ€™s orbit. According to our knowledge, there are around 500 solar systems in the universe. The outer solar system planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The sun is at the centre of the solar system, and the planets revolve around it in their own orbits. The rotation of the planets causes the days and nights, and the changing of seasons is caused by the revolution of the planets around the sun. Our solar system exists in the Milkyway galaxy. According to scientists and astronomers, the earth is the only planetary body where life can exist. But this can be proven wrong after more discoveries about the universe.</p>
